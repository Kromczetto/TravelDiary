This project leverages SwiftData, Firebase, and The Composable Architecture (TCA) to provide a seamless and efficient experience. Users will have two options for storing data:
- Locally using SwiftData
- In the cloud with Firebase
The application will allow users to create an account and securely store their data in Firebase. Additionally, it will feature an interactive map where users can mark the countries they have visited, enhancing their experience with a visual representation of their travels.
